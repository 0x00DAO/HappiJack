# HappiJack
HappiJack is a blockchain-based guessing game in which players guess an 8-digit number and store it in a smart contract on the blockchain. At the end of each game cycle, the smart contract automatically calculates the lucky number and distributes the bonus pool to the player who is closest to the lucky number.
